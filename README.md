### Website Frontend Template
For my first project in web development, I was given a static image of a design mockup and tasked with recreating it using HTML and CSS - without using any additional packages or frameworks as shortcuts. In my text editor, I wrote the HTML and CSS. I taught myself how to use CSS grid and flexbox to perfect the layout of the images. After setting up the structure of the page, I added a number of media queries to increase responsiveness to different screen sizes.
